# Shipping Container Aeroponics Tube Design

Centeralized plan to create a vertical aeroponics tube system. This system is designed to mimic the system in the [Freight Farms](http://www.freightfarms.com/ "Freight Farms"), but will be completely aeroponic. 



###Tutorials / Design Ideas
[6 inch ABS Aeroponic System](http://www.rollitup.org/t/building-a-6-inch-pvc-aeroponics-tube-system.18312/)
* Things I Like
  * Placement of sprayer between every other grow point(possibly every grow point?).

* Things to Improve
  * Use vinyl fence posts, cheaper over 8 ft then pvc by half.
  * Use 1/2 inch Pex tubing for main water feed tube instead of PVC(allows for 160 psi).
  * Number of pumps needed for larger scale build.
